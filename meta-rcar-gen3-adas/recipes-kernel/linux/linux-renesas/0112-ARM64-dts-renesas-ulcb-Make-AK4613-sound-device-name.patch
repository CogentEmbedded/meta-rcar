Subject: [PATCH] ARM64: dts: renesas: ulcb: Make AK4613 sound device name
 consistent

This makes AK4613 sound device name consistent throughout all
ULCB boards. This helps to avoid naming issues when pulseaudio
fails to start because the device has different names on
infotainment and starter boards. For example, "ak4613"
on Kingfisher vs "rsnd-dai.0-ak4613-hifi" on Starter Kit.
Pulseaudio is expecting "ak4613" name.
